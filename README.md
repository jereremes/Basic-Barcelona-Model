# BasicBarcelonaModel
 An attempt at making a running numerical model for the mechanics of partially saturated soils. 
 
 Feb12, 2025: built the whole code using Copilot. Need to do a lot of pen-and-paper stuff still, but everything seems to run, and heat flux excluded, everything seems to run fine.
